### Programming Problem Notes

 For each programming problem, let us know:

 - How we should compile your code (`g++` command or `make` target)
	Please use make to compile the files.

 - Design decisions you made or other non-trivial choices for your implementation
	For the part of search. I use a map between terms and products

 - Any additional tests you wrote and what files those exist in
	A file called test_class.cpp which test the class: book clothing movie and mydatastore,
	It can be compiled by make test

 - Known errors/anything to help us grade (though we will run automated tests,
knowing what features may be broken/missing may help us provide some partial credit)
